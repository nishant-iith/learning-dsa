## Introduction BST
- A binary search tree is a binary tree with ordering property
- For each node, all left subtree values are less than node's value
- For each node, all right subtree values are greater than node's value
- Efficient for searching, insertion, and deletion operations

## Basic Properties
- **Ordered Structure**: Left < Node < Right
- **No Duplicates**: Typically, BST doesn't allow duplicate values
- **Balance Factor**: Affects performance significantly
- **Height**: Minimum logâ‚‚(n+1), Maximum n-1

## Types of BST
1. **AVL Trees**
    - Self-balancing BST
    - Balance factor of -1, 0, or 1
    
2. **Red-Black Trees**
    - Self-balancing BST
    - Guarantees O(log n) operations

## Operations & Time Complexity
| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Insert    | O(log n)    | O(n)       |
| Delete    | O(log n)    | O(n)       |
| Search    | O(log n)    | O(n)       |

## Implementation (Basic Structure)
```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;
    
    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        left = right = null;
    }
}
```

## Common Operations
- Insert value
- Delete value
- Search value
- Find min/max
- Successor/Predecessor
- Validate BST

## Applications
- Database indexing
- Priority queues
- Symbol tables
- Memory allocation

## Space Complexity
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n)
- Worst Case: O(n)
